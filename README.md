# PricingAmericanOptions
We will use the Dynamic Chebyshev method to price American Options, and
then compare it to the least square Monte Carlo method, using three different models
for stock prices. We will challenge the results by performing robustness analysis, and
dive deeper into the simulation aspect of the methods by deploying variance reduction
technique.
